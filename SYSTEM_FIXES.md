# Complete System Audit & Fixes

## Issues Found & Solutions

### 1. ❌ **Cannot View Invoice Image/PDF**
**Problem:** Document viewer shows data but not the actual scanned invoice
**Solution:** Need to add:

- Embedded PDF viewer or image display

### 2. ❌ **Filtering Not Complete**
**Problem:** Missing filters for:
- Currency
- User/Approver
- Date range
- Amount range
- Document type

**Solution:** Add comprehensive filter panel

### 3. ❌ **Approval System**
**Problem:** Approval button exists but needs testing
**Solution:** Verify approval workflow works end-to-end
